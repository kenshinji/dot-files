# Dotfiles
Dotfiles are used for customizing operating systems. I store my dotfiles, scripts, and plugins in this repository to synchronize the preference and settings among various machines. Please star my repository if you find this resource helpful. If you have any questions or encounter technical problems, please create a "new issue" under this repository title. 


## Key Features
- Vim - [Vim](https://github.com/vim/vim) is an advanced text editor to manage the dotfiles. Additional customized functionalities will be added to repo.

- Tmux - [Tmux](https://tmux.github.io/) is a powerful software application to multiplex several virtual consoles, allowing a user to access multiple Linux/Unix servers remotely. I have customized a configuration file [here](./.tmux.conf).

- Zsh - [ZSH](http://ohmyz.sh/) shares many similar features as Bash Shell. I run Zsh for managing my dotfiles because of its helpful functions and plugins.
